(Exercise) the number guesser game

Ask the user's name and store it in a string
generate a random number between 1 and 100
Ask the user for a number
Give the user feedback (too high, too low, correct)
Stop when the user gets the answer correct
Keep track of the number of turns
seven turns is average
below 7 is very good
above 7 is a poor performance
